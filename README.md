# 140speedruns
This article is meant as a guide to speedrunning the game **140** by Jeppe Carlsen.

For a guide on catching the orbs as early as possible, see [this guide by Zet](http://www.speedrun.com/140/guide/7z6rx).

# Level 1
## 1.0
Hold right (and jump as appropriate) until you catch orb 1.1, then immediately turn left.

## 1.1
Don't miss elevator cycles, then catch the orb as far to the right as possible, as seen in the picture below.

## 1.2
After a short wait, land on the first block as it appears, then hold right until you get to the first incline. Jump when appropriate.
This is the beginning of **Level 1 Skip**.

There are two different ways to do the next part. Neither is faster than the other.

# Level 2
## 2.0
There is some leniency on this first orb. As long as you don't mess around too much, you should be able to catch it on the first cycle.

## 2.1
After you activate the first orb, hold right until you've passed both the snake bridges. (As usual, you have some jumping to do here as well.) Wait for the tunnel to close, then open again before entering. (Sidenote: you don't lose any time by entering it when you first arrive if you walk as far in as you can, but it looks unprofessional.)

When entering the snake bridge, you can only reach the first pillar. There is no rush to getting to the other side, as you need to wait for the orb cycle anyway.

## 2.2
Once you've activated the orb, hold left until you have landed on the first ledge.
